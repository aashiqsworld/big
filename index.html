      <notes>
        (1) How to position and pose the virtual contents. A specific difficulty with AR storytelling is that multiple virtual characters or objects might interact with each other, thus their positions and poses should be considered jointly
        
        (2) How to choose an optimal solution to accommodate the story event contexts. For example, between multiple chairs in a scene, which chair should a virtual character choose in an event? 

        (3) How to ensure the temporal coherence between the events of a story. Since a story happens chronologically, how to instantiate a story in a scene should not only consider spatial relations at a certain event, but also temporal relations between events at different time frames 

        (4) How to adapt the same story to different real-world environments.

    <notes>
      • We propose novel problem of interactive AR storytelling involving virtual characters, items, and events to take place in different real scenes, considering scene layouts and semantics.

      • We propose a hierarchical story sampling approach that adapts story events to the player's dynamic behaviors in a real environment. By sampling spatial candidates followed by story assemblies with temporal considerations, our approach supports interactive update of the story at runtime, enabling the player to participate as a character in AR storytelling.

      • We validate the effectiveness of our approach by conducting AR experiments and a user study in real scenes.

    <notes>
      An overview of the approach. In the preprocessing phase, scene semantics are extracted in a semi-automatic manner, and meanwhile a story graph is extracted from an input story script. A spatial candidates sampling process prepares a set of candidate AR content poses within each event locally. In the interactive storytelling process, the AR player keeps interacting with the AR contents at each event, and such interactions are passed as an input to the story assembly module for picking optimal spatial candidates for the following events adaptive to the player's actions.

      A story graph representation. A story graph consists of a sequence of event graphs. Each event graph Ge is rooted at its corresponding event node e. Each event graph comprises multiple spatial graphs. Each spatial graph SG, rooted at a nodes, contains the high-level spatial relations between the virtual characters C, virtual items I, and the furniture objects F in a room r € R. Instantiating a spatial graph with position and orientation attributes of the characters and items generates a spatial candidate. The two scenes on the right show the virtual characters and objects set using two spatial candidates of the spatial graphs rooted at si and s2, respectively. Instantiating an event refers to selecting a spatial graph and generating a spatial candidate of this spatial graph.

      (1) <em>spatial candidates sampling</em>: considers spatial constraints within each spatial graph SG for generating spatial candidates <br><br>
      (2) <em>story assembly</em>: uses the generated spatial candidates to assemble a story solution considering temporal constraints and dynamic player actions.
    </div>
      
  
    <notes> 
      Since a story is described in the tangled spatial and temporal domains, the overall search space can be large and sparse. It can be difficult to sample a story solution efficiently by directly modeling the whole story as a single configuration, especially when there multiple events that contain long temporal constraints, and when there are multiple virtual characters participating in a single event with complicated spatial constraints.

    During story assembly, for each event 𝑒, an event instantiation is selected, which comprises a selected spatial graph (rooted at a node 𝑠) together with its instantiation (i.e. a spatial candidate 𝛾 ). Red colors refer to the selected spatial graphs and spatial candidates of an assembled story.

Event instantiations (𝑒ˆ𝑡𝑎 ) are precomputed for all possible player actions 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 in this event and saved in the buffer Ω𝑡 , and one is picked for animation based on the estimated action 𝑎ˆ at runtime. Red color denotes the estimated action and selected event instantiation.
